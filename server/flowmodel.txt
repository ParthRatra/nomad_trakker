Used when you want to create a new object instance and immediately save it to the database in a single step.
This method simplifies the process of creating and saving by combining both steps into one.
You typically use this method when you don't need to perform extensive modifications or custom logic on the object before saving.

const newUser = await User.create({
  firstName,
  lastName,
  email,
  password: hashedPassword,
  image: `https://api.dicebear.com/5.x/initials/svg?seed=${firstName} ${lastName}`,
});
